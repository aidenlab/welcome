# Welcome to the Aiden lab software page! #


Juicebox is visualization software for Hi-C experiments. Using Juicebox, you can
* visualize Hi-C maps by zooming in and out over many magnitudes of resolution in real time
* compare Hi-C maps with ENCODE tracks, genes, loops/domains, other Hi-C maps, & more
* explore a large archive of published Hi-C experiments
* load your own Hi-C data by creating your map using [Juicer tools](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre) and opening it in Juicebox
* ...and more!

In addition, Straw and Juicer are also powerful tools to parse through hic genomic data. Look around to learn more!

# 3D Genomics #

If the DNA from a single cell was taken out and stretched end to end, it would span 2 meters. But all that DNA has to fold up tightly inside a single nucleus only a few microns wide. Studying the patterns and rules of DNA folding, and the implications this folding has for disease or epigenetics is the field of 3D genomics.

Hi-C data represent one major approach for studying 3D interactions within the cell, using a technique known as contact mapping. See more below from Dr. Erez Aiden's talk at the Scripps Research Translational Institute.
