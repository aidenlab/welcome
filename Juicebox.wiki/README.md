# Welcome to the Aidenlab #

Juicebox is visualization software for Hi-C experiments. Using Juicebox, you can
* visualize Hi-C maps by zooming in and out over many magnitudes of resolution in real time
* compare Hi-C maps with ENCODE tracks, genes, loops/domains, other Hi-C maps, & more
* explore a large archive of published Hi-C experiments
* load your own Hi-C data by creating your map using [Juicer tools](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre) and opening it in Juicebox
* ...and more!

In addition, Straw and Juicer are also powerful tools to parse through hic genomic data. Look around to learn more!
