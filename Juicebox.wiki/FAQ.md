# How can I access published Hi-C data?
You can use Juicebox and Juicer command line tools directly on URLs. Check out [our data page](http://aidenlab.org/data.html) for those links. We recommend this method as opposed to downloading full .hic files, but if there's an experiment you plan to explore a lot and/or you have a bad internet connection, you can download locally.

If you would like to download a local version of a .hic file, check out the GEO repository for the experiment. We have also put some maps up in a [Box mirror](https://bcm.app.box.com/v/aidenlab)

You can also parse the default properties file at http://hicfiles.tc4ga.com/juicebox.properties to grab the web address of the file you're interested in.

# How do I create my own .hic files from my own data?
Check out the Juicer command line tools [pre command](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre)
