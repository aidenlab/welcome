## Drawing Annotations

We can record the differences we see in the GM12878 and IMR-90 maps.

1. Right click the heat map
2. Select `Enable diagonal edge`
3. Draw custom hand annotations for the differential loops you see by holding down the `shift` key and drawing a box

> If you make a mistake, you can remove the annotation. Right click when within the box and select `Configure feature -> Delete`.

## Editing Panel Options

You can also configure the annotations (both loaded and custom annotations) by clicking `Show Annotation Panel` and then the `2D Annotations` tab. The current layer is `Layer 0`.

- You can rename the annotation by typing the box 
- Clicking the pencil will make the layer editable (this is useful when you import annotations) 
- The eye icon is for selectively turning visibility on and off 
- The color box allows you to change the color of all annotations in this layer
- The shaded icon makes the annotation more translucent
- The dotted box artificially enlarges the annotation
- The solid box icon toggles through options for only showing the annotation above or below the diagonal; this is especially useful in VS mode with annotations loaded for different files
- The ellipsis enables a mode whereby not all annotations are painted at the same time; this is useful when there are a very large number of annotations loaded
- The backwards circle undoes the last annotation drawn
- The circle with a slash clears all annotations in this layer
- The mini heat map creates a submap.
- The page with a green arrow allows you to export the annotations to a file on your local computer in the .bedpe human-readable format
- The two pages icon duplicates this layer
- The arrows allow you to move the annotation up and down in the list, and thus affects priority of which annotations are drawn (similar to Photoshop layers)
- The trash icon can deletes this layer
