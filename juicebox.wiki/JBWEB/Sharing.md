# Sharing URLs (Web)
Juicebox on the Web is especially powerful because you can share your results with collaborators quickly and easily. Simply click the Share button at the top. A bitly link is autogenerated. You can also embed the results within an iframe, generate a QR code, or tweet your image! Check out the following link: [https://tinyurl.com/yakc54hs](https://tinyurl.com/yakc54hs)  Note that not only are the zoom location and annotations preserved, but custom color changes, naming changes, and comments typed at the bottom of the page are as well!
