* compare Hi-C maps with ENCODE tracks, genes, loops/domains, other Hi-C maps, & more
* explore a large archive of published Hi-C experiments
* load your own Hi-C data by creating your map using [Juicer tools](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre) and opening it in Juicebox
* ...and more!
