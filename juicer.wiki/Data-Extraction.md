[Straw](https://github.com/aidenlab/straw) is our tool for fast reading of local or remote `.hic` files. The web addresses for various `.hic` files are listed on [our data page](http://aidenlab.org/data.html).  You can also find them by looking at [the Juicebox properties file](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicebox/wiki/Loading-Maps-(the-File-menu)#changing-the-menu).
