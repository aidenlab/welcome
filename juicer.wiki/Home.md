# What is Juicer? #
Juicer is a one-click pipeline for processing terabase scale Hi-C datasets. Using Juicer, you can

- Go from raw fastq files to Hi-C maps binned at many resolutions
- Automatically annotate loops and contact domains with the [Juicer tools](Juicer-Tools-Quick-Start)
- Run the pipeline [in the cloud](Running-Juicer-on-Amazon-Web-Services), on [LSF](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/tree/master/LSF), [Univa](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/tree/master/UGER), or [SLURM](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/tree/master/SLURM), or on a single [CPU](https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer/tree/master/CPU)
